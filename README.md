# KEYBOARD-LESS-GAMING
The project "Keyboardless Gaming," is a computer vision-based system that enables players to control in-game actions in Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) using hand gestures instead of a keyboard. Utilizing advanced image processing and machine learning techniques, the system recognizes predefined gestures to perform various in-game functions such as movement, entering and exiting vehicles, handbrake application, and speed boosts. 
Traditional gaming input devices such as keyboards and controllers limit the interaction between players and games. Gesture-based control systems offer a more intuitive and immersive gaming experience. With the advent of computer vision and machine learning, it is now possible to interpret real-world hand gestures into meaningful in-game actions.
This project introduces a vision-based hand gesture recognition system specifically designed for GTA V. By employing computer vision techniques, the system identifies hand gestures and maps them to in-game actions, reducing the reliance on conventional input devices
