# KEYBOARD-LESS-GAMING
The project "Keyboardless Gaming," is a computer vision-based system that enables players to control in-game actions in Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) using hand gestures instead of a keyboard. Utilizing advanced image processing and machine learning techniques, the system recognizes predefined gestures to perform various in-game functions such as movement, entering and exiting vehicles, handbrake application, and speed boosts.
